Background:
Imagine you have a customer, a larger company with petrol stations 
spread all over Europe. For a competitor analysis, the customer 
would like to know how many petrol stations there are per operator in 
Switzerland and which are the 5 largest operators in terms of the total number 
of petrol stations. To solve the task you decide to use the following workflow:

1.) You first look at the following website https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:amenity
    for the key:value pair which you can use to get data from OpenStretMap
 
2.) Then you prepare a Jupyter notebook in which the overpass Web API is used to get the data
    
3.) You save the data in .json and .csv format on your local computer

4.) You count the number of petrol stations per operator using pandas' .pivot_table() method
    You sort the pivot table to identify the 5 largest operators

5.) Finally, you create a map to visualize all petrol stations in Switzerland
    In the map, use popups to provide the brand of the petrol stations.

# Simulating the Monty Hall problem with Python
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Run the Jupyter notebook 'simulation_monty_hall_problem.ipynb' step by step.

2.) In the Jupyter notebook, create a new section 'Proportion of wins in 
    relation to the number of trials'. In this section, create a line chart
    which shows the proportion of wins on the vertical axis and the number of 
    trials on the horizontal axis. For this, you can use the following code:

    # Create list to store number of trials using range(from, to, step width)
    list_iter = range(1, 100, 1)

    # Create list to store the proportion of wins
    list_wins = []

    # Foor loop
    for i in list_iter:
        
        # Simulations with switch = True and 3 doors
        list_wins.append(run_trials(i, True, ndoors=3) / i)

    # Show wins
    list_wins

    # Graphic
    plt.plot(list_iter, list_wins, color = 'green')
    plt.axhline(y = 0.66, color = 'gray', linestyle = '--')
    plt.title('Proportion of wins in relation to the number of trials')
    plt.xlabel('Number of trials')
    plt.ylabel('Wins (%)')
    plt.ylim([0, 1])
    plt.grid(linestyle='-', linewidth=0.1)
    plt.show()

3.) In the line chart above, change the number of trials to 5000 and the 
    step width to 5. Based on the line chart, answer the question, whether it 
    would make sense to change your initially choosen door after the gameshow 
    host reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors.

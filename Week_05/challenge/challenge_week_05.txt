Background:
A bicycle dealer has collected data about bicycles and bicycle-related products 
from tutti.ch using the Web Scraper extension for Google Chrome. Before the data 
can be analysed, it must be brought into the correct form. The bicycle dealer 
has (unfortunately) no Python programming skills and asked you for help. In 
detail you are asked to do the following with the raw data.

1.) Create a Jupyter notebook, import the bicycle data to a data frame, count 
    the number of rows and colums, look at the data types, count and remove the 
    missing and duplicated values.
 
2.) In the data frame, create a new variable 'price' with an 'int' as data type.
    Note that it can be necessary to remove all records with empty '' price 
    strings in this process.
    
3.) Create a subset of the data frame which contains only prices in the range
    >= 200 und <= 2000 CHF.

4.) Create a histogram and a boxplot to show the distribution of prices in 
    the subset.

5.) Save the name of the city / canton from the address string in a new variable
    of the data frame.

6.) Create a dictionary with all prices per city / canton.

7.) Access the dictionary to show all prices in the city of ZÃ¼rich.

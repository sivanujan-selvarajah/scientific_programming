In Visual Studio Code with the Python extension installed:

1.) Create a Jupyter notebook file with Visual Studio Code.

2.) The Jupyter notebook must include:

- a header (markdown cell)
- a numpy array of random numbers
- a calculation of quartiles of the random numbers (use the percentile() method from the numpy library)
- a histogram based on the numpy array
- a boxplot based on the numpy array

3.) Use the Color Theme 'Night Owl (No Italics)' in Visual Studio Code.

4.) Save the Jupyter notebook as .ipynb file and open it with the Google Chrome extension 'Jupyter Notebook Viewer'.

5.) Export the Jupyter notebook as HTML-File (check whether the library 'jupyter_contrib_nbextensions' is installed)
